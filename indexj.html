<h2>Pakistan’s mystery spinner Abrar Ahmed has arguably been the team’s standout bowler during the ongoing Asia Cup, and he’s been rewarded for his efforts by breaking into the top five of the ICC Men’s T20I bowlers’ rankings for the first time.<hr><br>ALSO READ
Sydney Thunder Set for Historic Pakistan-India Spin Partnership in BBL <hr>  The 26-year-old climbed to No. 4 in the latest update, reaching a personal-best rating of 703 points after his impressive spell against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi. His accuracy and ability to outfox batters in crunch moments have made him one of Pakistan’s most dependable options in the shortest format.

Abrar’s rise continues a breakthrough year for the spinner, who has quickly established himself as a frontline bowler across formats. His success in T20Is comes on the back of consistent performances in the national colours. In five matches at the Asia Cup, Abrar has picked up five wickets at an economy rate of just 4.62, underlining his growing importance to the team.

By entering the elite top five, Abrar joins the ranks of Pakistan’s finest limited-overs spinners in recent years, following in the footsteps of Saeed Ajmal, Imad Wasim, and Shadab Khan, all of whom previously featured prominently in ICC rankings.

Meanwhile, Shaheen Afridi (25) and Haris Rauf (28) have seen improvements in their rankings, while Sufiyan Muqeem (14) and Mohammad Nawaz (46) have dropped.</h2>
